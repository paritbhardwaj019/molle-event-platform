-- This migration documents existing database changes that were applied directly
-- All changes already exist in the database, so this is effectively a no-op migration

-- Note: The following changes were already applied to the database:
-- 1. Gender enum was created
-- 2. fcm_tokens table was created
-- 3. allocation column was added to packages table
-- 4. gender and hostFeePercentage columns were added to users table

-- No SQL commands needed as all changes already exist
